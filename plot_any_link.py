# This script reads packet data from the listen node through the serial port
# and prints one RSS measurement on each line for all tx, rx, ch combination,
# where the rx != tx, both rx and tx are in the list of sensors, and ch is in 
# the list of channels.
#
# Operation: Run this script in the terminal.  There are no command line parameters
# We assume that you are only using a 2 node setup.
# The channelList must match the channels that are programmed on the nodes
# You can also select which channels to plot using the ch_list.  Select any ordered numbers between 1 and the number of channels programmed on the nodes
